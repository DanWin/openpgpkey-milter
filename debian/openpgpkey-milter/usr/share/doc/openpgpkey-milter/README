##### WARNING ########

This is pre-release software. It's only been testing by me on my personal
postfix server. Running this anywhere on a production machine might cost
you your job, although please do let me know how it failed you.

openpgpkey-milter is a sendmail/postfix milter service that will attempt
to automatically PGP encrypt plaintext emails received by the mailserver
before relaying the message further towards the recipient. These can be
messages received from localhost or from the network for relaying.

It looks for the special OPENPGPKEY DNS record, see:
http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wouters-dane-openpgp-01

The hash-slinger package (as of version 2.3) contains an openpgpkey
command that can be used to generate OPENPGPKEY records (currently using
private RRTYPE 65280 and generic record syntax until the IANA process
for requesting an RRTYPE has completed.

To use openpgpkey-milter with postfix, add to /etc/postfix/main.cf

smtpd_milters = inet:127.0.0.1:8890
non_smtpd_milters = $smtpd_milters
milter_default_action = tempfail
milter_protocol = 2

If you run opendkim, ensure you add openpgpkey-milter _before_ opendkim
or you'll break the opendkim signatures. For the fedora/rhel configuration
with opendkims using port 8891, use:

smtpd_milters = inet:127.0.0.1:8890, inet:127.0.0.1:8891
non_smtpd_milters = $smtpd_milters
milter_protocol = 2
milter_default_action = accept

There is no mailing list yet. Please send questions and bug reports
to paul@nohats.ca. However if you run openpgpkey-milter on your mail
server and it broke, you might be better of mailing me at the unsigned
domain paul@cypherpunks.ca.
